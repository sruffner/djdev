    Generate an inter-spike interval (ISI) histogram for a specified series of spike times.

    Args:
        spike_times: Array of spike times in seconds. Need not be in chronological order.
        max_isi_ms: The maximum inter-spike interval M included in the histogram, in milliseconds. Default = 100. This
            parameter defines an array of evenly spaced times between 0 and M inclusive, representing the centers of the
            1ms histogram bins over which the ISIs are counted. Minimum value of 20 ms.

def generate_cross_correlogram(

    Generate a cross correlogram for two series of spike times.

    Args:
        spike_times_1: Array of spike times for a neural unit, in seconds. Need not be in chronological order.
        spike_times_2: Array of spike times for a second neural unit, in seconds. Passing the same array into both
            arguments yields the auto-correlogram for a single neuron.
        span_ms: Correlogram span in milliseconds. Default = 100. Minimum value of 20.
    Returns:
        A 2-tuple (C, n). C is a Numpy array containing the computed correlogram, while n is the # of spikes in the
            first neuron that were included in the analysis (spikes within 'span_ms' of the beginning or end of the
            recorded time frame must be excluded). The correlogram is essentially a histogram of how likely a spike
            occurs in the second neuron at some time before or after a spike occurred in the first neuron at t=0. The
            histogram will have 2S+1 1-ms bins between -S and S, inclusive, where S is the specified correlogram span.
            Each element contains the count of unit 2 spikes in the corresponding time bin. To get a relative measure of
            the likelihood of a spike occurring in each bin, divide each bin count by n.

        ValueError: If either array of spike times is empty.
